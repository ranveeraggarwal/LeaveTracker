AaiKya: Leave Tracker
===

In the pre-digital era, tracking the leaves for household helps was done on a physical calendar that hung somewhere on the kitchen wall. Well, now you no longer need to fumble for a pen to mark that leave date, when you can do it on an app.

Presenting AaiKya.

Track the leaves taken by your household help - using a simple intuitive interface. Use the calendar interface to actually see the number of vacations taken in a month. Prevent arguments about the correct salary at the end of the month.
